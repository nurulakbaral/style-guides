# Style Guides

Most projects define their own style guide: a set of conventions—sometimes arbitrary—about how code should be written. A consistent style makes it far easier to understand and maintain a large codebase.

“Style” can mean many things, from choosing camelCase for variable names, to avoiding global variables, to steering clear of exceptions. This document outlines the style guidelines I follow in my projects. If you’re contributing or making changes, refer here to see the conventions that apply.
